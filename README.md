# INVOICE APP COMPONENTS FOR GLEAN :D

Had a lot of fun building these out! I tried to make the components match perfectly to the design file across all 
browsers. Light/Dark mode toggle is just a matter of replacing any class of 'light-theme' to class 'dark-theme' 
through the use of css custom properties and their scopes. 
-In Dropdown.js I used javascript to dynamically insert a ul for the dropdown so that I could keep the semantic 
'select' and 'option' elements in the HTML with the user input data flowing through them for accessiblity to 
screen readers and SEO. I needed the ul to be inserted for specific styling, due to limited styling capabilities 
on 'option' elements.
Made a little bit of extra work for myself but very worth it.
Cheers!
